# VFSG_UNDP_Accelerator_Lab_Project
The data cleaning/transform script for the dataset provided by UNDP.

Welcome to my Viz for Social Good [UNDP Accelerator project](https://www.vizforsocialgood.com/join-a-project/2022/9/15/undp-accelerator-labs-network) repository!
This repository hosts the:
* Original dataset
* Cleaned up dataset that can be download [from here](https://github.com/knadoor/VFSG_UNDP_Accelerator_Lab_Project/blob/main/Output/vfsg_undp_clean.xlsx)
* Python code that does all the data cleaning/transform magic ;-)

I hope this repository acts as a good experience for others to learn from.

The cleaned up dataset can be loaded into a BI tool such as Tableau, Power BI etc.

If you have any questions regarding the script, any suggestions or need consulting advice on any data project, feel free to contact me on my [LinkedIn profile](https://github.com/knadoor/VFSG_UNDP_Accelerator_Lab_Project/blob/main/Output/vfsg_undp_clean.xlsx).

Take care!
